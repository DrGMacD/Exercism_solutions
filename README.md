# Exercism Solutions
[![Ask DeepWiki](https://devin.ai/assets/askdeepwiki.png)](https://deepwiki.com/DrGMacD/Exercism_solutions)

This repository serves as a collection of my personal solutions for the programming exercises on the [Exercism](https://exercism.org/) platform. It documents my journey and progress through the Python track.

## Repository Structure

The solutions are organized by programming language. Currently, the repository contains solutions for the Python track.

Each exercise is located in a directory named after the exercise itself. Within each exercise directory, you will find numbered subdirectories (`/1`, `/2`, etc.). These numbers represent the sequential iterations of my solution, reflecting refinements and improvements made over time.

For example, the path to the final solution for the "Blackjack" exercise is:
`solutions/python/black-jack/6/black_jack.py`

## Solved Python Exercises

This repository includes solutions for the following Python exercises:

*   **Blackjack**: Functions to simulate and score a game of Blackjack.
*   **Currency Exchange**: Functions to perform currency exchange calculations.
*   **Ghost Gobble Arcade Game**: Functions implementing the rules of a Pac-Man-like arcade game.
*   **Guido's Gorgeous Lasagna**: Functions to calculate baking and preparation times for a lasagna recipe.
*   **Hello World**: A simple "Hello, World!" function.
*   **Meltdown Mitigation**: Functions to monitor a nuclear reactor and prevent a meltdown.

## Disclaimer

These solutions represent my own work and approach to solving the exercises. If you are also a student on Exercism, it is highly recommended that you attempt to solve the problems on your own first to maximize your learning experience.
